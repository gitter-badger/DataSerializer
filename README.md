## Data Serializer

This is a simple data serializer that will allow you to transform one JSON object in to another one, in a different format, via rules. This is a complete rewrite of the library of the similiar name (dataserializer) by kulakowka, with full backwards compatibility to that library, despite no code remaining from that library (even the tests are completely altered, though it would still pass the original tests). A deeply nested object model is now supported.

I would highly recommend that you just take a look at the test.js file to get a feel for how it works. Here is a quick sample of what is possible:

```javascript
var Serializer = require('data-serializer');

var model = { username: 'crueber', firstname: 'Christopher', lastname: 'Rueber', password: 'qwerty', profile: { email: 'someone@somewhere.com' } }
var collection = [model, model];

var rules = {
  'username': true,
  'firstname': false,
  'email': 'profile.email',
  'myinfo': { email: 'profile.email' },
  'fullname': function() { return this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname; },
  'password': function() { return false; }
}

var model = Serializer(rules, model);
console.log('Serialized model', model); 

var collection = Serializer(rules, collection);
console.log('Serialized collection', collection); 

/*
Serialized model 
{ 
  username: 'crueber', 
  email: 'someone@somewhere.com',
  myinfo: { email: 'someone@somewhere.com' },
  fullname: 'Christopher Rueber' 
}

Serialized collection 
[ 
  { 
    username: 'crueber', 
    email: 'someone@somewhere.com',
    myinfo: { email: 'someone@somewhere.com' },
    fullname: 'Christopher Rueber' 
  },
  { 
    username: 'crueber', 
    email: 'someone@somewhere.com',
    myinfo: { email: 'someone@somewhere.com' },
    fullname: 'Christopher Rueber' 
  } 
]
*/

```
